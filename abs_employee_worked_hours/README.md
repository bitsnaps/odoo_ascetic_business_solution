Employee Working Hours
----------------------

To empower the user by providing the decision making knowledge is one of the key areas to focus while implementing ERP.

Our effort towards providing analysed information mining through the already existed data produces this another new Odoo module.

The main purpose to develop this module to extend the human resource management application to get the right set of working hour data in every employee in Odoo.

This module will give the actual working hours of the employee in the employee kanban view according to the current week and current month by considering the timesheet and attendance. These things will help in the evaluation process of the employee by weekly and monthly bases.
